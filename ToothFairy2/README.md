# ToothFairy2 Challenge (MICCAI 2024) - Multi-Structure Segmentation in CBCT Volumes

This is the second edition of the ToothFairy challenge organized by the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia with the collaboration of Raudboud University. The challenge is hosted by grand-challenge and is part of MICCAI 2024.

For any information, please visit the [challenge page](https://toothfairy2.grand-challenge.org/) or the [Ditto website](https://ditto.ing.unimore.it/toothfairy2/).

We are currently working to provide a initial example of algorithm as a starting point for your submissions. In the meantime, you can check the template of the previous edition, which would be quite the same.
