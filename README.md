# ToothFairy Challenge (MICCAI 2023)

This is the first edition of the ToothFairy challenge organized by the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia with the collaboration of Raudboud University. The challenge is hosted by grand-challenge and is part of MICCAI2023.

### Algorithm template and Evaluation source code
This repository contains the information and source code for the [algorithm template](https://github.com/AImageLab-zip/ToothFairy/tree/main/algorithm), which you can use as a starting point to develop your own algorithm, and the [evaluation source code](https://github.com/AImageLab-zip/ToothFairy/tree/main/evaluation) which is helpful to check how the evaluation is performed.

### Challenge and Dataset
For any information about the challenge, please visit the [Grand-Challenge website](https://toothfairy.grand-challenge.org/).
