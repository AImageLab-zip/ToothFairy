# ToothFairy Evaluation

This is the source code for the evaluation of the submitted algorithms on the
Grand-Challenge platform. The code for computing the Dice coefficient and the
Hausdorf distance 95% can be found inside the `evaluation.py` file, under the
`compute_dice()` and `compute_hd95()` functions.

If you found any problem related to such algorithm, please report it to us by
opening an issue in this repository.
